However, closer to the deadline, he didn’t remember our agreement and became very angry that parts of the project weren’t ready. I briefly explained my position and then suggested a plan to provide the client with our finished work and follow up quickly with the rest. My manager and I later agreed to start formalizing important changes in writing to avoid confusion.
